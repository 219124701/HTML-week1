HTML IS A PROGRAMME THAT IS USED TO CREATE WEBPAGES , IT SERVES AS A CHANNEL FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTENT LIKE WORDS , IMAGES ect.. it also forms a solid foundation for everything in the digital realm. it has straight forwad structure with out any programming logics. it gives reselent and robustness, also can handle alot of abuse but still deliver. 
CSS : is the stylist of a web page it ia responsible of how things looks it is also fragile but powerful at the same time
if the code has a problem the browser will skip that part and move to the rest
JAVASCRIPT : it is a programming language that allows us to create intereactive staff, it can do things that html and css cannot do
it is fragile in a way that if theres an issue in the code and it does not understand the code it gives up it also refuses to run tha javaScript and will not even try to figure out the problem.

TROUBLE SHOOTING AND DEBUGGING ON html IT CHECKS THE SYNTAX OF YOUR html CODE AND REPORTS ANY ERROR, html DEBBUGING CODE THEY USE NOTEPAD ++THAT SHOWCASES VARIOUS HTML ELEMENTS
we have atributes 1. class- it is commonly used and it assign a reusable name to any element 
                    2. id - can be used for CSS targeting , the uniqueness of an ID it ensures that there will always just one element with that ID
ARIA ROLES - it is an atribute that can be added to html elements to convey the right message about the content's meaning , it plays a role when we want to provide essential information to screen readers and magnifiers to ensure the web is fully accessible.

FORMATING HTML -it referes to the way text is displayed on a web page , comments are inserted by putting tags at the start and at the end
we use elements greater and less pre , code tags or tags with text area also if you are modifying the whitespace handling with CSS then extra spaces can matter .

Navigation and linking
To create a link we use an A element wich is an anchor inorder to do this we need to to add href attribute that is used to  specify the URL or destination of a hyper link and this href with URL is eclosed in quotes, and the URL is the one the one that takes us to the link, URLs are versatile and when you linking to another website you can iclude the entire URL. There are types of URL which is absolute and it is called absolute becouse it a precise location on the web. 
HTML URL PATHWAYS : in html when specifying paths for resources like images , stylesheets or links you typically encounter two pathways which is absolute path that specifies the complete URL or file path from the root . If the absolute URL were used for all links the browser will keep trying to access files
 TO CREATE A URL FROM SCRATCH : you need to see how files are organised and there is RELATIVE domain how to createe it ? you need to ommit the domain name but include the initial slash at the begining and this helps the browser to start from the root level of the file structure . Secondly you need to specify the path to a resource relative to the current document or lacation .
 HOW TO CREATE A LOCAL URL : creating a local URL it involves specifying the path to a resource withinyour local file system e.g if your HTML file and another file are in the same directory     you can create a local link . 
NAVIGATION : It referes to the system or process of moving between different pages within the website . Common elements in navigation incude menus , links and buttons that guide users through the structure of the site, secondly links are wrapped in an element with the correct URL and then eclosed in a li (list) tags. to indicate the that the site is navigating  you have to encompass the menu in a nav (tags) and it needs to appear by using css styling.Breadcrumbs are a navigation aid on website showimg usesrs the path fromthe home page to the current page and are are wrapped in nav element using orderd list ol tags.
